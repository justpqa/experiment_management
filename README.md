### Experiment Management System

This is the experiment management system that I created to help people tune different PyTorch model for the MNIST problem. In order to start the program, follow these process:

- Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt (can use a virtualenv if needed)
- Run the app by: python app.py
- Access: https://127.0.0.:5000
- Stop the app by Ctrl-C on the terminal window that you used to start the app.
